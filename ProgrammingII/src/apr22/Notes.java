		 * Generic(??)
		 * 
		 * Dynamic Data Structures
		 * 
		 * ArrayList:
		 * 	Can only handle objects, can not handle ints (use Integer instead)
		 * 	.set, .size(), .add, .remove, 
		 * 
		 * Collection
		 * 	an interface: contains method names, but not code that make up those methods
		 * 
		 * Hashset Class
		 * 	used to store a set of objs
		 * 	uses the same <> notations as ArrayList; initialized same way as arraylist
		 * 	if u use hashset, must override hashcode and toequals method
		 * 		
		 * HashMap
		 * 	takes two types: Ex: <String, Integer> where the first parameter is the KEY
		 * 	.put is the same as .add in arraylist
		 * 	Initialized the same way as array ist, just with two obj instead of one
		 * 	search through hashmap by using .containsKey to see if tht key is in the hashmap
		 *  .printmap(hashmap) to print all contents i think
		 *  
		 * Class LinkedLIst
		 * 	linked data structure 
		 * 		collection of items
		 * 	dynamic data structure
		 * 	links items in a list to one another
